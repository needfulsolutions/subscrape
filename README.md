# subscrape

A tool written in Python to scrape all posts and media from a given subreddit, storing it needfully in a directory named after the working subreddit.

This tool currently supports the following:

* links to .png, .jpg, etc.
* most forms of reddit galleries
* redgif.com 

Due to reddit limitations, only 1000 posts can be reached per listing/timeframe.
